Structure pattern:
Show statusmessage with "Clear filter" button when filters are applied.
Show visually if a filter is set.
Allow multiple status messages.
Querystring popover button: filter icon, "Filter" tooltip.
Change message from misleading "Cannot order items while querying" to "Drag and drop reordering is disabled while filters are applied.". Fixes: https://github.com/collective/plone.app.locales/issues/173
